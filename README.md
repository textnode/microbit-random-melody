Probably buggy, but still fun!

Requires micropython

Connect to microbit micropython REPL

import ran

ran.run()

Follow the instructions on the microbit screen by tilting the microbit in all directions until the led grid is completely lit (this calibrates the compass).


Operator instructions:

Keep microbit tilted to the left to select one octave lower.

Lay microbit flat to select middle octave.

Keep microbit tilted to the right to select one octave higher.

Re-orient microbit (compass heading) and press button A to select different seed for note generation.

Touch logo button to generate next few bars of notes from seed.

Press button B to play the current bars.



Selection of seeds is repeatable so you can reproduce pleasing sequences of notes.


In the code you will see you can also wire in different scales.


Enjoy!
