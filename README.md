# microbit-random-melody

Probably buggy, but still fun!

Operator instructions:

Tilt microbit left to select one octave lower.

Lay microbit flat to select middle octave.

Tilt microbit right to select one octave higher.

Re-orient microbit (compass heading) and press button A to select different seed for note generation.

Touch logo button to generate next few bars of notes from seed.

Press button B to play the current bars.


Selection of seeds is repeatable so you can reproduce pleasing bars.


In the code you will see you can also wire in different scales.


Enjoy!
